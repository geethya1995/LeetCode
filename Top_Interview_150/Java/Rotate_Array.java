/* --- Notes ---
Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the array.
    - Time to complete step 2, to swap the entire array of n elements: O(n)
    - Time to complete step 3, to swap the first k elements: O(k)
    - Time to complete step 4: to swap the remaining: O(n-k)
    - Accumulation of time: O(n) + O(n) = O(n)

Space Complexity: O(1), since weâ€™re performing in-place modifications without additional storage. Even if the length of the array increases, we wouldn't need extra/additional space to run this algo as same 'n', 'start', 'end', 'temp' vars are used.
