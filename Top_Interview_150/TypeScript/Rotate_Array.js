    * When rotating an array, if k (number of rotations) is greater than or equal to n (length of the array), it means that rotating the array n times brings it back to its original position.
    * So, any rotation beyond n would essentially just be the remainder of dividing k by n.

/* --- Notes ---
Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the array.
    - Time to complete step 2, to swap the entire array of n elements: O(n)
    - Time to complete step 3, to swap the first k elements: O(k)
    - Time to complete step 4: to swap the remaining: O(n-k)
    - Accumulation of time: O(n) + O(n) = O(n)

Space Complexity: O(1), since weâ€™re performing in-place modifications without additional storage. Even if the length of the array increases, we wouldn't need extra/additional space to run this algo as same 'n', 'start', 'end', 'temp' vars are used.
